<h1> Hey there, I’m Aaditi Rathore </h1>

I am a third-year student pursuing graduation from Hindu College, University of Delhi. 
I am interested in data, and have an aptitude for numbers. I like to keep myself up-to-date with business related trends and knowledge.
I like to connect dots while constantly trying to learn new ways to think and be. 
Psychology and human behaviour interests me and philosophy gives me a borader perspective, and pushes me to be reasonable in life. I am passionate about translating business requirement into effective solutions and analysing data to bring about fundamental change and improvement in strategy, and functioning of company.
